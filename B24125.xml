            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ted for to make me known unto every one, without which it would be too long before I should be known. It may be some will say; that this my Science is but a deceitful enterprize, as there are some old Women and Midwifes, who sometimes have a little Book, cut of which they gather their Sciences, whereby they intend to cure all men: But it is not so with me, who have learned these my Sciences of my Father and Husband, who both were Ph<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sicians, and of such esteem amongst Men, as well Noble, as others; that there appeared no accidents, how ever so great in the humane body, as well Men as Women, whereunto their advice had not been required. And whereas many Women became to be subject unto the hereafter specified Diseases, and for shames sake, remained hidden; because they durst not discover them unto any Physician, whereby they were forced to remain in their misery: Therefore my Father and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band were necessitated to discover such Diseases unto me, and to teach me the curing thereof; whereby (under Gods blessing) I have restored above a thousand Women and young Maidens.</p>
            <p>FISRT, I cure Women and Maidens of the suffocation or rising of the Mother, which hapneth when the Mother swelleth, or is blown up, or that any rotten substance be in her by restraining of the natural flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or some Corruption of Nature, or by some Apostumation, which becomes to rot in the Mother, which appeareth by dissiness of the Head, heaviness, squeamishness in the throat, and upon the Heart so much, that the Patients many times think to dy of it, much tumbling in the Belly, or some other indisposition of the Mother, which cause a great many dangerous accidents or distempers, as Sterility, Obstruction, and many others.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, I cure the descending or hanging out of the Mother, whereby the strings wherewith the Mother is tyed unto the body, become to be streatched; be it so, that it is caused by Child birth, hard cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, or working, or some unnatural moistness; I presently dress, and cure it with such dexterity, that never before the like was seen of any besides me.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, I cure Women or Maidens, who cannot get their natural Flux, or who have the same too much, as there are some that have a continual Flux. I cure likewise the white Flux, filthiness of the Mother, after which Women commonly rest fruitless, I make them (by the help of God) fruitful. I cure without delay the griping of the Guts, also the spoiled and lost Appetite, which causeth the pale Colour, and makes Maidens sometimes to have strange stomack, even as Women that are big with Child: For strange things, as <hi>Morter, Stone, Sand, Coals,</hi> and other like things, which Diseases most become to be caused in the Orifice of the stomack of Maidens, who long for such Food. I cure likewise all Women and Maidens from Vomiting, which proceeds from an obstruction of the Mother. I cure Women of the quivering and shaking, which oftentimes proceeds from the same cause. I have also cured many that had the Dropsie, and were so thick, as if they had been big with Child, and fainted oftentimes. And also such as had the Leprosie, and were oftentimes subject unto great Agues. There is another kind of Disease when the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy is not purged, so that a body alwayes is very sorry and continually troubled with heavy thoughts; wherefore I have cured many that were come so far, that they were in a rage, or mad; so that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to kill themselves, or another. I cure all sorts of Hemorroides at the Fundament, or Nature of Women, all sorts of Shapes, Warts, or any fleshly Excrescency in the Orifice of the Bladder, or Mother. I close and cure all sorts of Issues in the Fundament: Likewise all Women and Children that are bursten, be it under or above the Navel, although they had been bursten twenty Years. I take the Stone from Women and Maidens without cutting: And there is not, nor never was before me any Woman that ever shewed this rate Art at any Woman, but my self.</p>
            <p>I have likewise a Physick, which I oftentimes have tried to be good for Persons that are troubled with pains in the Reins, which proceeds from the gravel, or such as have pain in making their Water, or in whom the Stone beginneth to grow, or them that cannot keep their Water, and go leaking, of whatsoever cause it proceeds. I likewise cure all great pains, as the Gout, or pains throughout all the Limbs, that the Arms, or Legs grow crooked, be it by shrinking, or weakning of the Sinnews with great dolors, though the Person had kept his Bed many Years for weakness, I shall make him nimble again, by Gods assistance.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:195865:2"/>
            <p> I cure likewise the <hi>Morbum Gallicum,</hi> or the French POX, and running of the Reins, and all other Venereal Distempers, without fluxing; so that the Husband cannot perceive it from his Wife, nor the Wife from her Husband, in such a manner, that the like never was seen of any besides me. I also cure all Wens, Excrescencies, Boyls, the terrible Canker at Womens <hi>Breasts, Mouth, Tongue, Neck,</hi> or any other part of the Body, by a peculiar new invented Art. And I cure also divers great Diseases of the Eyes, as Cataracts, Films Pearls: Also the Dropsie, and other like Evils, too long for to relate here. I further make take away all Pock-holes, Freckels, or Wrinkels of the Face. I make the Hair to fall out, where it is too much, and make it grow, where it is too little, and can colour it according to every ones Fancy. I make white all black Teeth, and cure the stinking Breath, and divers other Diseases, which for shortness sake, I here omit, being impossible to specifie all Infirmities in this small Bill.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, I make known that by the continual Experiences and Science which I had from my Father and Husband, I have many fine Arts, never heard of heretofore, and subtile Chyrurgical Sciences; so that scarce any Disease can besal unto the body of a Woman, however so great, but I have cured the like. Therefore if any one wanreth my Assistance, let him or her come unto me, or let them send their Urine, and I shall tell them the cause of their Distemper.</p>
